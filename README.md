# Recount
Alternative version of Recount (WoW 2.4.3 addon) fixing PoM on Warmane. 
It will deviate from normal Recount behaviour only if the combat log shows to be wrongly configured, such as on Warmane. In other words, on other servers, or if Warmane combat log gets fixed, this addon should still work correctly (i.e. even though you won't need this addon anymore, it will still work the same as normal Recount, so you won't need to swap back). 

## How to install
You can download the archive via Github by clicking on *Clone or Download* -> *Download ZIP*. Then you will need to extract it, remove the *-master* at the end of the name of the folder, and finally move it to your WoW/Interface/AddOns folder. 

Alternatively, you can also just check the last commit and do the change yourself, manually.
