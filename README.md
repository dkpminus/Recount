# Recount
Alternative version of Recount (WoW 2.4.3 addon) fixing PoM on servers showing owner in combat log (typically Warmane Outland)
It's basically the same addon with PoM tracking algorithm disabled. 

## How to install
You can download the archive via Github by clicking on *Clone or Download* -> *Download ZIP*. Then you will need to extract it, remove the *-master* at the end of the name of the folder, and finally move it to your WoW/Interface/AddOns folder. 

Alternatively, you can also just check the commit(s) and do the change yourself, manually. 

NB : if you switch back to another server *not* displaying PoM owner in the combat log, you'll have to go back to the original Recount (or undo the change yourself).
